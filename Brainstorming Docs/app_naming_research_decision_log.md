# App Naming Research & Decision Log

## Purpose of This Document
This document records the official outcome of the product naming brainstorming session for the short‑form video analytics application. It captures the reasoning process, the final name selection, and a set of vetted backup names for future reference.

This documentation is intended for internal use only (product, design, marketing, and engineering alignment).

## Product Context

The application is a **creator‑first analytics tool** designed to help content creators:
- Identify **high‑performing and trending short‑form videos**
- Analyze performance based on **views, likes, comments, and velocity**
- Track trends across **Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts**
- Focus on **signal and momentum**, not hashtags or surface‑level virality

The name needed to support:
- Short‑form video culture
- Data, systems, and flow‑based analytics
- Long‑term scalability beyond a single platform
- A modern, SaaS‑ready brand identity

---

## Naming Exploration Summary

During the brainstorming process, several naming directions were explored:

### 1. Systems & Analytics Language
Names inspired by data infrastructure, signal processing, and information flow:
- Signal Flow
- Data Flow
- Signal Stack
- Trend Pipeline
- Signal Layer

These names conveyed credibility and analytical strength but leaned more toward B2B or enterprise tooling.

---

### 2. Directional & Discovery Metaphors
Names based on momentum, sourcing, and early detection of trends:
- Upstream
- Upcurrent
- Content Current
- Headwaters

These performed well conceptually and aligned strongly with trend discovery, but some lacked immediate short‑form creator clarity.

---

### 3. Short‑Form Creator‑Native Language
Names that directly reference clips, shorts, reels, and fast‑moving content:
- VidBuzz (competitive reference)
- ClipFlow
- VidSignal
- ShortStream
- ClipCurrent

This direction successfully anchored the product in creator culture while remaining modern and brandable.

## Final Name Selection

### ✅ Final Name: **Short Flow**

#### Why This Name Was Chosen

**Short Flow** was selected as the final product name because it best balances **creator clarity** with **systems‑level credibility**.

**Key reasons for selection:**

- **Immediate relevance**: The word “Short” clearly anchors the product in short‑form video (Shorts, Reels, Clips).
- **Flow‑based metaphor**: “Flow” communicates movement, momentum, velocity, and trend progression over time.
- **Signal over hype**: The name implies structured discovery rather than viral guessing or hashtag chasing.
- **Creator‑first tone**: Approachable and intuitive for creators without sounding gimmicky.
- **Scalable branding**: Supports future features, analytics layers, and product extensions.

The name communicates the core value proposition succinctly:

> *Understanding how short‑form content moves, performs, and trends across platforms.*

---

## Brand & Product Fit

**Short Flow** aligns cleanly with:
- Trend velocity scoring
- Cross‑platform ingestion
- Time‑windowed analytics (7d, 30d, 60d, etc.)
- Momentum‑based discovery
- Creator dashboards and visual signal tracking

It avoids:
- Platform lock‑in
- Overused viral terminology
- Enterprise‑heavy or academic tone

---

## Approved Backup Names

The following names were identified as strong alternatives and are approved for backup use if needed (e.g., legal, domain, or branding conflicts).

### Tier 1 Backups (Closest to Final Direction)
- **Signal Flow**
- **ClipFlow**
- **ShortStream**
- **Content Current**
- **VidSignal**

### Tier 2 Backups (More Brand‑Forward)
- **Upstream**
- **ClipWave**
- **VidRadar**
- **ReelFlow**
- **TrendPipeline**

All backup names were evaluated against the same criteria as the final name.

- **Approved Name:** **Short Flow**
- **Audience:** Content creators
