## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)** for ShortPulse. It is the internal source of truth used to align:
- Product decisions
- Feature prioritization
- Marketing and positioning
- Pricing strategy
- Onboarding and education

ShortPulse is built for **individual creators**, not enterprises. Every decision should be evaluated against this ICP.

---

## 2. One‑Line Core Promise

**“I always know what content is working right now.”**

Everything ShortPulse does ladders up to this promise.

---

## 3. Product Definition (Context)

ShortPulse is a **data‑driven content intelligence and creative suite** for short‑form video.

It focuses on:

- TikTok videos
- YouTube Shorts

ShortPulse surfaces **objective, real‑world performance data** on content that is *already working*, so creators can:
- Extract patterns
- Model proven formats
- Generate strategic inspiration
- Build repeatable content systems

This is **not** a guessing tool, hype tool, or virality promise. It is a **source of truth**.

Execution determines results.

- Monetization is unclear or early

**Audience size:**
- Common: 0–1K followers

## 6. Who This Is NOT For

ShortPulse is **not** built for:

The unifying trait is **intent**, not age or geography.

Including:

If a user fails:

---

## 17. Long‑Term Vision Alignment

But the foundation remains:

**Truth → Patterns → Execution → Scale**

---

## 18. ICP Summary (Final)

The ideal ShortPulse customer is a **growth‑stage individual creator** who:
